I am a theoretical computer scientist by training and I enjoy thinking about fundamental problems. 

After my PhD, I became a quantitative researcher helping Canadian banks build algorithmic trading models. Although not very fundamental itself, quantitative trading does give rise to fundamental questions about how to make good decisions under uncertainty.

These days I think about how to make advanced AI systems safe.

I am generally a fan of the "TCS approach" to solving problems and try to apply it everywhere, including in algorithmic trading.
