I am a theoretical computer scientist by training and I enjoy thinking about fundamental problems. 

After my <a href="https://dspacemainprd01.lib.uwaterloo.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/e01dd539-06c7-4b02-92c2-d7c04a456804/content">PhD</a>, I became a quantitative researcher helping Canadian banks build algorithmic trading models. 

These days I think about how to make advanced AI systems safe. My recent work has been on on designing adversarially robust training algorithms.

I am generally a fan of the <a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/avi/book">TCS approach</a> to solving problems and try to apply it everywhere.
