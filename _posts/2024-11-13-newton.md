I recently read this Feynman quote:
> Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.

And decided to express some long-suppressed irreverance on this blog: I think Newton did a terrible job summarizing his work in terms of those three famous laws of motion. For reference, here are the three laws (from Wikipedia):
1. A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a force.
2. At any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the body's acceleration multiplied by its mass or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.
3. If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.

Let's first start with the obvious issue here. The first law sounds like a weaker form of the second law? The second law already says $$F = ma$$. If you assume $$F=0$$, then as long as the body exists (and thus has non-zero mass), the only possibility is that $$a = 0$$. And by the definition of acceleration, $$a = 0$$ implies that the velocity does not change. So law #1 is actually implied by law #2.
